# Untitled Card Game

This is an open-source videogame still in its early stages. The concept is based around the **cult classic** [Cultist Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator/). Always wanted to say that.

I'm brushing up my front end skills and what better way than to develop a complex card game entirely on react, css, and the react-spring animation library. The motto of this project is that if it's shown on the screen, it has to be self made. No class components, all hooks. I honestly don't know what I'm doing half the time so don't use this as best practices reference!

# Project and Release

The actual card game will not be included here in this repository, nor will it be licensed under MIT. You will be able to create and use your own playsets or those made by others, but the idea is to eventually create a complete game and release it on steam!

# Stack

The project is built on electron, webpack, and eslint. Just having node installed should be all you need to get it running. Binaries will come when the project is in a playable state.

# Getting started

```
yarn install
yarn build-electron
```

and on a second shell...

```
yarn start-electron
```

That's it! You're up and running!

Enjoy the mostly unfunctional main menu with animated letter soup :)
